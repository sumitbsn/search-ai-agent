# Web UI Architecture for AI Agent with Search and LLaMA Integration

## Overview
Create a modern web interface that combines search functionality with local LLaMA model analysis. The application will allow users to search for information and have the results analyzed by a local Ollama LLaMA model.

## Architecture Components

### 1. Frontend (React)
- **Search Interface**: Clean, modern search input with real-time suggestions
- **Results Display**: Organized presentation of search results with analysis
- **Chat Interface**: Interactive chat with the LLaMA model
- **Analysis Panel**: Display of LLaMA model's analysis of search results
- **Responsive Design**: Mobile-friendly interface with smooth animations

### 2. Backend (Flask)
- **Search API**: Integration with web search functionality
- **LLaMA Integration**: Interface with local Ollama LLaMA model
- **Analysis Engine**: Process search results through LLaMA model
- **CORS Support**: Enable cross-origin requests for frontend communication
- **WebSocket Support**: Real-time communication for streaming responses

### 3. Key Features
- **Search Functionality**: 
  - Web search with multiple query support
  - Real-time search suggestions
  - Search result caching for performance
  
- **LLaMA Analysis**:
  - Analyze search results for relevance and insights
  - Summarize multiple search results
  - Answer questions based on search context
  - Stream responses for better UX

- **Interactive UI**:
  - Modern, responsive design
  - Real-time updates
  - Smooth transitions and animations
  - Dark/light theme support

## Technical Stack
- **Frontend**: React with modern hooks, CSS modules, and responsive design
- **Backend**: Flask with CORS support and WebSocket integration
- **AI Model**: Local Ollama LLaMA integration
- **Search**: Web search API integration
- **Styling**: Modern CSS with animations and responsive breakpoints

## API Endpoints
- `POST /api/search` - Perform web search
- `POST /api/analyze` - Analyze content with LLaMA model
- `POST /api/chat` - Chat with LLaMA model
- `GET /api/models` - List available Ollama models
- `WebSocket /ws/stream` - Stream LLaMA responses

## User Flow
1. User enters search query in the interface
2. System performs web search and displays results
3. User can request LLaMA analysis of the results
4. LLaMA model analyzes and provides insights
5. User can continue chatting with the model about the results
6. All interactions are saved and can be exported

## Security & Performance
- Input validation and sanitization
- Rate limiting for API calls
- Caching for search results
- Efficient streaming for large responses
- Error handling and graceful degradation
